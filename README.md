# MinimumSpanningTree

#Small project implementing both Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree in undirected graphs.
#Learned from advanced algorithms class, Prim's Algorithm uses a Near array and Kruskal's uses Heapsort and Disjoint sets.

#Included are Word documents and an Excel file which show the data output of the program such as the minimum spanning trees and computation times.
